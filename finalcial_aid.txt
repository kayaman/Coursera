I am from Sao Paulo, Brazil. I have considerable experience but at the moment I am unemployed and facing a huge personal financial crisis. I want to attend the specialisation and I need to get certified because I need the certificates to help me on applying to job offers. Most companies ask for the certificate during the hiring process. 
I do not have a credit card at the moment. I would pay for the course if I could, but, unfortunately, at the moment, I really can't.
I am an experienced backend developer, with experience on many programming languages and different industries. I decided to invest time and effort studying data science skills a few years ago, but could not get a job in the area yet. At the beginning of this year (2018) I joined a startup to work with Natural Language Processing but the startup bankrupted and left me unemployed. My goal on taking this course are getting deeper knowledge on Data Science in Python to be able to apply to Data Science jobs, follow my career and, most important of all, get a job.

Enrolling in an AI course can significantly enhance my career prospects and help me secure employment, especially in my current state of being unemployed. The course will equip me with in-demand skills in machine learning, data analysis, and algorithm development, which are highly valued across numerous industries such as technology, healthcare, and finance. By gaining proficiency in AI, I can position myself as a competitive candidate for roles like data scientist, AI engineer, and machine learning specialist. Furthermore, obtaining AI credentials will reflect my dedication to continuous learning and my ability to adapt to new and emerging technologies. This not only broadens my knowledge base but also demonstrates to potential employers my commitment to professional growth and innovation. Ultimately, an AI course will provide me with the expertise and confidence needed to excel in todayâ€™s dynamic job market and secure a fulfilling career. I promise to do my best effort.
